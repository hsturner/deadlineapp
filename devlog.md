Base Task class is finished, and seems to be working from testing, so I need to think about how to implement it into the larger app. Obviously, a user will have multiple tasks, and tasks should be able to be categorized by the user into subgroups, so I think I need some sort of user class that has some data structure that can store my task objects.

Right now I'm just working on finishing a rough implementation of a user class. Each user will have access to an an array of task objects that has a special ID field that will match with the one generated by the user during the class constructor. The other issue that I'm not going to address right now but will have to later regards the security of user password. I can easily set it to init only, but then that makes it impossible for users to change their password. This could be addressed by creating a new user class and migrating over all the members? idk seems like a bad solution. Will address later
