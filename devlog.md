Base Task class is finished, and seems to be working from testing, so I need to think about how to implement it into the larger app. Obviously, a user will have multiple tasks, and tasks should be able to be categorized by the user into subgroups, so I think I need some sort of user class that has some data structure that can store my task objects.
